Chess is one of the most popular games played throughout all history. Some
people, for reasons unbeknownst, got bored with the plane Jane version though,
and started making new versions of the game. These variants are called "Fairy
Chess" and have been a classic set of problems for countless chess players,
mathematicians, and now computer programmers! 

One of the Fairy chess pieces is known as the "princess"- it moves similarly to
the queen, but does not possess the ability to move up and down, left and right.
Stated another way, the princess combines the bishop and the knight. It is able
to move in the L-shape of the knight, but can move infinitely far on the
diagonals. 

In this problem, you'll find a solution to the N-Princesses problem- how many
unique solutions exist for placement of N princesses, such that no princess is
attacking any other?

Example: For N=5
