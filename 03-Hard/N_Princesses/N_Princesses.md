Chess is one of the most popular games played throughout all history. Some people, for reasons unbeknownst, got bored with the plane Jane version though, and started making new versions of the game. These variants are called "Fairy Chess" and have been a classic set of problems for countless chess players, mathematicians, and now computer programmers!

One of the Fairy chess pieces is known as the "princess"- it moves similarly to the queen, but does not possess the ability to move up and down, left and right. Stated another way, the princess combines the bishop and the knight. It is able to move in the L-shape of the knight, but can move infinitely far on the diagonals.

In this problem, you'll find a solution to the N-Princesses problem- how many unique solutions exist for placement of N princesses, such that no princess is attacking any other?

Example: For N=8, this is one solution

For N=5, this is another:

Input: A single number, N, which is both the size of the board and the number of princesses to place. 

Output: A single number, which is the number of solutions for that given N.
