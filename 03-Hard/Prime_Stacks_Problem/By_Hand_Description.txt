An example of a scaled-down version of this problem, with three stacks and six
numbers.

Given input as such:

8 7 3
7 5 1


move 1:          move 2:
8 7              8
7 5 1            7 5 1
3                3 7


move 3:          move 4:
                 1
7 5 1            7 5
3 7 8            3 7 8

move 5:
1 8
7 5
3 7

Since 173 is prime, and 857 is prime, the solution is found.
The output is as follows:

8 7 3
7 5 1
1 8
7 5
3 7
