Your discrete math professor loves the towers of Hanoi problem SO much.  She also loves prime numbers for her own inscrutable reasons.  She has decided to combine them into a new problem, in lieu of your final exam.  You are given three stacks, two of which are filled with 6 integers each.  Your task is to rearrange the integers such that the digits at each level of the three stacks make a 3-digit prime number.  Her example is as follows:

             Before:          After:
Row 6   | |  | |  |  |      | |  | |  | |
Row 5   |7|  |3|  |  |      | |  | |  | |
Row 4   |4|  |9|  |  |      | |  | |  | |
Row 3   |9|  |3|  |  |      |1|  |1|  |3|
Row 2   |1|  |6|  |  |      |1|  |6|  |3|
Row 1   |1|  |5|  |  |      |4|  |9|  |9|
Row 0   |1|  |7|  |  |      |7|  |5|  |7|

Stack    0    1    2        0    1    2

You can expect an input of two lines, each with 6 comma separated digits, representing the contents of the full stacks.  Implement your stack, complete the problem, and then output the contents of your stacks in the
same manner you received them.  For the the example above,
the input you would get from the command line would be:

1,1,1,9,4,7
7,5,6,3,9,3

And the output you would create would be:

7,4,1,1
5,9,6,1
7,9,3,3
