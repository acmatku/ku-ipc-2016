A set of warring city states are separated by a barren, roughly rectangular no-man's land, such that half of the cities are on the left end of the no-man's land, and the other half are on the right side. Pairs at a time of these city states are allied with each other, but they do not necessarily reside directly opposite each other. Each pair of allies wishes to construct elevated highways to connect themselves across the no-man's land, but because of the ongoing state of war, highways from separate pairs cannot be allowed to intersect. As a good war opportunist who owns the largest concrete mixing company, you want to find the maximum number of city pairs that can be connected such none of your highways overlap. 

Read from STDIN two lines of space separated integers. The first line contains *n* numbers in ascending order, the second line contains *n* integers in a random order. Pairs of equal integers denote two cities that wish to construct a highway between themselves.
