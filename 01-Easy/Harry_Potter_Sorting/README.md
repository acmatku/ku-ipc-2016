Welcome to the Hogwarts computer database! We need your help. Currently, we’ve just scribbled the first letter of each student’s house to the left of their name. We have “G” for “Gryffindor,” “H” for “Hufflepuff,” “R” for Ravenclaw, and “S” for “Slytherin.”   We would like our directory to be sorted by house so we can easily see who is in each of the houses. Below we’ve included how our current directory stands (“Input”) and what we’d like for you to create (“Output”). We would like the houses to be listed alphabetically; and, under each house, we would like our students to be listed alphabetically.

Input:
```
G Harry Potter
S Draco Malfoy
G Hermione Granger
H Newton Scamander
S Severus Snape
S Tom Riddle
R Luna Lovegood
R Myrtle Warren
```

Output:
```
Gryffindor:
Harry Potter
Hermione Granger

Hufflepuff:
Newton Scamander

Ravenclaw:
Luna Lovegood
Myrtle Warren

Slytherin:
Draco Malfoy
Severus Snape
Tom Riddle
```
