We are so excited for IPC that we are looking through words to find the letters “I,” “P,” and “C.” When we find a word with any of those three letters, we will give the output “FOUND,” and when we do not find any of those three letters, we will give the output “MISSING.” The input and the output will both be in all caps.

Example input:
```
COMPUTER
BOOK
SCHOOL
LEARN
RULER
```

Example Output:
```
FOUND
MISSING
FOUND
MISSING
MISSING
```
