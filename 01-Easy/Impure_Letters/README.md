We are so excited for IPC that we are looking through words to see if they have the target letters “I,” “P,” and “C” in them. We are only interested if the target letters are in the order "IPC." If the letters are not in order, or if not all three letters are present, the output is "INVALID." If the three letters are present, and in order, the output is the number of letters in between the target letters.

Example input:
```
RIPCORD
DREAM
IMPERFECT
SCEPTIC
IMPACT
```

Example Output:
```
0
INVALID
5
INVALID
2
```
