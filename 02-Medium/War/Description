The classic card game war has simple rules: Each player begins with half of a deck of cards, and every for every round of play, they compare the top card of their decks.  If either player has a higher card, they win the round, and both cards are placed on the bottom of their deck.  If there is a tie (a war), both players move three cards to the bottom of their decks, then compare the top card of their decks.  This process repeats until one player wins, at which point they place all the cards played in that round at the bottom of their deck (in order).

The game is over when a player loses all their cards.  A modified version of War allows each player the option of flipping an extra card during each round of a war.  If the sum of the first card and the flipped card are less than 15, they may count both cards toward their total for that round.  However, if they exceed 15, they lose the round and the opponent keeps the cards as usual.

Your task is to determine whether each player would win or lose based on a threshold;  If a war occurs and a player's card is below their threshold, the player will opt to flip an extra card.  Otherwise, the player will not. This choice hould be made at every war. You will be given two lists of strings representing the face value of each player's cards, followed by two more lists representing the threshold each player will use for each game.  You should return a series of integers separated by spaces, where 1 means the first player wins or 2 means the second player wins.
