You live in Hydrotopia, where everything is ran off of hydroelectric power
generated by your city's dam. You, being the Chief Energy Officer of the dam,
are charged with determining the efficiency of a dam given a set amount of water
stored in the sections of the dam. The efficiency of the dam is measured
in cycles of a generator - that is, a generator turning on to move water from
one section to another.

There are some caveats:
-   A generator cannot move water higher to a height higher than the generator
    itself
-   All generators pump water from left to right
-   Water must completely settle before it can be pumped again; that is,
    given:
    ```
    X X
    XW1
    XXX 2 X
    XXX X X
    XXX 3 X
    XXXXXXX
    ```
    Generator 2 would not be able to pump the water that 1 pumps out because
    the water would have to settle at the bottom of the section first, meaning
    Generator 3 would be the one to pump it.
-   Water must be contained within the rock walls of the section; it cannot flow
    over one wall into another section

Given the input below - where ```X``` denotes a portion of the rock wall, where
```W``` denotes a unit of water that can get moved by a generator, and ```G```
denotes a generator - determine the layout of the dam after the generators have
operated at full efficiency.
